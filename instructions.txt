steps : 
1-shown is the video how to use node js to convert very big csv to manipulate csv 


required task : just create a simple webpage with two buttons named upload csv and download csv button 

1- when upload csv button is clicked you can pick up  csv from pc storage rather than putting it manually as in video 
2-then node js in repeater.js should run 
3- on clicking download csv button manipulated csv should be donwloaded . 


use this csv as testing purpose !  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t6LxtDkl20uVUyaI3YF8eLepYn1VJVjU/view?usp=share_link
